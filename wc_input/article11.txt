OTTAWA - Groups fighting for language rights have hit a snag in their
campaign to revive the mandatory long-form census.
Graham Fraser, commissioner of official languages, has issued a
preliminary ruling that he does not have the power to reverse a
decision made by politicians.
The report was obtained by The Canadian Press.
But Fraser doesn't let the federal government off the hook completely.
He warns the Tories could be held accountable if their decision to
eliminate the mandatory long-form census questionnaire winds up
undermining the delivery of government services to francophones living
outside Quebec or to anglophones living within Quebec.
Linguistic minority groups say they now have all their hopes pinned on
the Federal Court, where a judicial review is looking at whether the
government is breaking its legal commitments.
