OTTAWA - The Conservative government will spend half of what it
promised to encourage Canadians to fill out the 2011 short census and
a new voluntary survey.
The National Household Survey replaces the mandatory long-form census
that was cut over the summer by cabinet.
Dozens of critics, including provincial ministers, the former chief
statistician of Canada and academics, had warned reliable data would
be lost if the long questionnaire was made voluntary.
Industry Minister Tony Clement said that $30 million in spending had
been earmarked to encourage Canadians to fill out the survey and the
short census.
But Statistics Canada told The Canadian Press that $5 million of that
money will cover extra printing costs, since more households will get
the voluntary survey.
And another $10 million of the pot is now going toward adding two
extra questions on language into the short census.
The government agreed to add two questions on the use of Canada's
official languages after facing intense pressure from groups
representing minority francophone communities over the summer.
The total cost of the 2011 census could reach $660 million.
That number includes an increase of the number of dwellings in Canada,
as well as additional mailing and printing costs.
The 2006 census cost $573 million in 2010 dollars, including a $43-
million purchase of software and equipment.
The Conservative government axed the long-form census in late June,
saying it was trying to find a balance between the need for reliable
information and the right of Canadians to refuse to respond to
detailed, personal questions.
