According to a BBC story
published Feb. 4, the last living speaker of an ancient Indian language
recently passed away, taking with her the legacy of the Bor dialect.
According to linguist K. David Harrison, nearly half of the world's
7,000 languages are close to extinction. As part of a project called
Enduring Voices, Harrison is looking at language preservation and
whether it's important to maintain dying mother tongues.
Statistics Canada estimates that in Canada alone, there are close to 50 indigenous languages spoken
across the country. Linguistic experts fear that only a handful of
these, including Cree and Ojibwa, will survive the next generation.
However, communities are struggling to hold on to some of these and in
British Columbia two First Nations communities have created "language nests" to teach children their heritage languages.
Studies have shown that the second generation of immigrants in North
America often lose their mother tongues through lack of use and
assimilation.
