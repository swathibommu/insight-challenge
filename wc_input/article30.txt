OTTAWA - Statistics Canada ran a million-dollar test and had extensive
consultations before the Conservative government killed the mandatory
long-form census.
Documents obtained by The Canadian Press show that senior bureaucrats
believed as recently as March that the process would include the
mandatory long form.
StatsCan believed the Conservative cabinet would be publishing the
details of both the long- and short-form questionnaires in April.
Instead, the Conservative government pulled the plug on the long form
in June and replaced it with a voluntary survey.
Industry Minister Tony Clement says his government made the decision
it did because certain final deadlines were approaching.
