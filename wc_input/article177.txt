P.O.V.: Should the census be mandatory? Take our poll.
Industry Minister Tony Clement acknowledged the resignation "with regret."
He maintained his defence of the government's decision to shift to voluntary disclosure in the census.
"The government took this decision because we do not believe Canadians should be forced, under threat of fines, jail, or both, to divulge extensive private and personal information," Clement said.
Sheikh said he would not comment on the advice that he and Statistics Canada gave to the government on the subject of the long-form census.
Assistant chief statistician Wayne Smith has been named the interim head of Statistics Canada.
