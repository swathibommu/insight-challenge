In Chinese philosophy the concept of yin yang is used to describe how polar or seemingly contrary forces are interconnected and how they give rise to each other in turn.Yes I got that from Wikipedia.  But the entry does not mention that the concept also applies to politics.Exhibit A: the unsettling display of people singing a pro-census song in their backyard, as highlighted in an Inside Politics recent blog.Now Exhibit B: a downright terrifying anti-census video. I know, I know, this one is clearly not the handiwork of opponents of the mandatory long form census.  The title makes it clear that it is spoofing the concerns of  people who find the mandatory long form too intrusive.But the two videos together do establish the emotional framework of the debate.  The mandatory long from census: do you love it or fear it?  Now ask that question to the version of yourself from one month ago.  Bet the answer is, "Huh?"
