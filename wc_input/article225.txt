By CBC NewsLiberal MP Marc Garneau introduced a motion in the House of Commons Tuesday calling on the federal government to reinstate the mandatory long-form census, despite continuing insistence by the Conservatives that it is intrusive and unnecessary.&amp;nbsp;The Liberals, along with the Bloc Québécois and NDP, argue the 40-page version of the census provides valuable data that economists, social agencies and municipalities use in making policy decisions.&amp;nbsp;"Why is it that this government did not realize that by switching from a compulsory census to a voluntary census that they would be jeopardizing this priceless database?" Garneau demanded. "It was clearly a bad decision."&amp;nbsp;"There have been over 350 well-respected groups that have said 'Stop this insanity. Do not do this. This is the wrong thing to do,'" he said.&amp;nbsp;Conservatives remain undeterred, however, reiterating their position that the census demands too much private information from Canadian citizens.Read moreDo you think the new, mandatory short-form census and voluntary
