OTTAWA - A group trying to kill Conservative changes to the census
faces a showdown in court Wednesday.
That's the day that the francophone group will learn whether Federal
Court will fast-track its case.
The group — the Federation des communautes francophones et acadiennes
du Canada — argues that the court needs to deal with the case before
October.
Otherwise, it says, the Harper government's elimination of the
mandatory long-form census could be unstoppable.
The group is asking for an injunction blocking the change and argues
that the new policy is unconstitutional.
