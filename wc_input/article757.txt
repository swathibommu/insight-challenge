Another unforgettable soccer moment
I think we can all agree, as soccer aficionados, that it is a crime and travesty when an important soccer game in the World Cup is decided by the umpire.
But that's exactly what happened this morning as Germany faced off against Serbia. The German guy, Klose, got a yellow card and then tripped the Serbian guy in kind of a mean way and got a second yellow card. In soccer, getting a yellow card is like being told that you're a person of questionable character. But here's the deal: two yellow cards equal one red card. A red card definitively declares that you are a bad, bad person, not to be tolerated. When you get the red card you are sent away, banished, exiled, with the red card taped right to your forehead. And get this: Your soccer squad cannot replace you or even mention your name for the rest of the game.
So there's Germany, now playing with, what, only like 8 or 9 guys, right? And Serbia still has the full contingent, plus the psychic advantage of knowing that the umpires now officially have declared that the Serbians are more likable.
So what do you know: Within about a minute of the Klose red card, the Serbians attack on the left flange of the German defense, and in a truly unforgettable moment, a Serbian guy named Kravic or Kradjic or something like that lobs (with his foot) the ball from the baseline to the front of the goal where another Serbian guy heads it and then a third Serbian guy kicks it in for the point.
I'm about to watch the second half, but, frankly, I'm thinking the Serbian advantage against the red-carded Germans is your classic insurmountable 1-0 World Cup lead.
