You can count Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK) as a fellow traveller of the Birther movement, the Politico reports, if he's not in fact a full-fledged Birther himself.
"They have a point," said Inhofe. "I don't discourage it. ... But I'm going to pursue defeating [Obama] on things that I think are very destructive to America."
Oklahoma's other Senator, Tom Coburn, previously said he would support the Birther bill if it made it to the Senate. So while Birtherism may be a fringe conspiracy theory, it does have some high-level support in at least one state in the Union.
Late Update: Inhofe's office has given Greg Sargent this statement, explaining the point that the Birthers have -- putting the blame on the White House for failing to address people's doubts: "The point that they make is the Constitutional mandate that the U.S. President be a natural born citizen, and the White House has not done a very good job of dispelling the concerns of these citizens. My focus is on issues where I can make a difference to stop the liberal agenda being pushed by President Obama."
