OTTAWA — The government has been asked to produce in five days all documents and emails sent between Statistics Canada, the Privy Council Office and Industry Minister Tony Clement’s office pertaining to the changes to Canada’s 2011 census, following a full day of sometimes heated testimony Tuesday in a parliamentary committee.After a month of public debate and heavy criticism of the Conservative government’s decision on the long-form census, the parliamentary industry committee met Tuesday to hear from a wide range of witnesses on the issue, including the privacy commissioner, official language groups, former Statistics Canada officials and Clement, who oversees the agency.“I believe our government’s decision strikes a balance between collecting the necessary data and protecting the privacy rights of Canadians,”Clement said. “We made that decision, not Statistics Canada. I’ve made it quite clear that StatsCan would have been quite happy to move along with the status quo.”The committee ultimately passed two motions, one that the government table the documents and another calling on it to reinstate the mandatory long-form census — a motion that will be presented for a vote when the House of Commons resumes sitting in the fall. The government has five days to comply with the first motion, though what documents it will produce remains to be seen, as some information will be protected under oath as advice to cabinet.“I don’t think that the government has any issue releasing anything that can be released,” Conservative MPMike Lake told the committee.Last week, chief statistician Munir Sheikh stepped down from his post to protest the government’s move to make the mandatory long-form census voluntary. He explained to the committee he felt compelled to resign following a 30-year civil service career because the integrity of the agency he led was cast into doubt over the controversy.Sheikh did not blame Clement or on anyone else specifically, but emphasized that he couldn’t stay when the agency’s credibility was being questioned in media reports.“It doesn’t matter to me what the minister said,” he said. “To me, it’s what the perception is out there and what Canadians believe in that would have an impact on whether or not I can do my job.”Sheikh, who was accompanied by his lawyer, was overcome with emotion early in his testimony as he read aloud a column by Alex Himelfarb, Canada’s former senior civil servant as Chief of the Privy Council, explaining that the Canadian civil service operates on a code of “fearless advice and loyal implementation” and praising Sheikh’s long career and principled resignation. “The issue for us is the quality of our data, and even there the government had to acknowledge, as the minister did, that they are the ones who make decisions, not the civil servants,” Sheikh said.At the end of June, the government announced it was scrapping Canada’s long-form census in favour of a voluntary survey that would collect the same information on ethnicity, income, education, disability and housing. The decision was made in response to privacy complaints and out of conviction that the government doesn’t have the right to pry for such information, Conservatives say.Critics say a voluntary survey will produce skewed and potentially unusable information for the organizations, departments, researchers and companies that rely on census data.Sheikh said no statistician would ever have recommended that replacing a mandatory census with a voluntary survey would yield equivalent results, though he made it clear the government had every right to make changes to the census, even without the agency’s blessing.“I want to underline that any voluntary survey is intrinsically biased,” said Ivan Fellegi, the previous chief statistician, who retired in 2006 and testified alongside Sheikh.Bias is a “sneaky, pervasive risk” statisticians seek to understand but never do, Fellegi said, and the more detailed the data is — census information is often used for very small geographical areas — the more “pernicious” the bias.Opposition MPs blasted the government for creating a “manufactured crisis”over the census,grilling Clement on how many Canadians complained on privacy grounds and where the evidence was of those concerns. NDP MP Claude Gravelle accused the government of “playing up to the media” with its repeated statements that the census is invasive because Canadians are being threatened with jail and fines. He questioned why the government couldn’t simply remove the penalties. “This was a manufactured crisis,” said NDPMPCharlie Angus. “You don’t have evidence to show this was bubbling up as a problem.”Conservative MP Maxime Bernier and Marie-France Kenny, president of the Canadian Federation of Francophone and Acadian Communities, engaged in a heated debate, with Kenny accusing the government of failing to uphold its obligations under the Official Languages Act. The charter guarantees that all Canadians will be served in the official language of their choice, she said, but without the robust, detailed language information gleaned from the long-form census, it will be difficult to track those needs.The federation has taken the government to court over the census issue, on Monday requesting a judicial review of the Tories’ decision.Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart said her office had received about 50 complaints pertaining to the census over the last 20 years. Compelling people to reveal their personal information under threat of penalties fundamentally fails to uphold their privacy rights, she said, but added later that Statistics Canada has always been receptive to input from her office and has made adjustments over the years to minimize infringements.“For many Canadians, this is seen as an invasion of privacy,” she said of the census. “I want to point out, though, that for others, they view it as a civic duty and not an invasion of privacy.”Postmedia News
