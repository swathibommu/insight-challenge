OTTAWA - The three federal opposition parties are poised to vote in
favour of a motion to revive the mandatory long-form census.
The Liberal motion would eliminate the threat of jail time, but keep a
$500 penalty for Canadians who refuse.
Industry Minister Tony Clement had indicated the government will
ignore the motion.
Clement is accusing the opposition of supporting the continued
harassment of people who simply don't want to divulge their personal
information.
The Conservative government quietly scrapped the mandatory long-form
census in late June, and replaced it with a voluntary survey to be
distributed to more households.
But Statistics Canada has acknowledged the data will not be as
reliable, and some of it unusable.
Clement says his government was striking a balance between the privacy
rights of Canadians and the government's need for information.
Liberal Industry critic Marc Garneau says if the government really
believed in their position, they should have first consulted with
Canadians and their own advisory council on the move.
