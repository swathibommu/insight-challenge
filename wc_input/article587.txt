In honour of the first-ever UN-declared World Statistics Day,  Industry Minister Tony Clement, pictured, sent a memo to all  Statistics Canada staff yesterday, congratulating them on their  sterling reputation and hard work--just months after killing  StatsCan's mandatory long-form census. "It is my pleasure, as the  minister responsible for Statistics Canada, to congratulate the men  and women of Statistics Canada on building what is universally  recognized as a world-leading national statistical office," Mr.  Clement wrote. His message was sent to staff by Wayne Smith, the  acting chief statistician who took over when former StatsCan head  Munir Sheikh resigned in July in protest of the government's  decision to kill the mandatory long-form census.
