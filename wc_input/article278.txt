A Calgary family concerned about their children's homework load has signed a contract with their school to eliminate the problem altogether.
Tom Milley and his wife have signed a formal "no homework" contract with the school.
"With two children in school, there was just an inordinate amount of homework coming home and a lot of it was busy work," said Milley.
The family has signed a differentiated homework plan with the Catholic school. Their daughter and son -- in grades 5 and 7 -- won't have to bring work home. Instead, they'll be marked only on work they do in the classroom.
