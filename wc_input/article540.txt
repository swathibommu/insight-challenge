A Saskatoon woman found guilty of refusing to fill in the long-form census in 2006 has been granted an absolute discharge.Sandra Finley, 61, “is clearly a person of good character who refused to fill in the form on the basis of principle,” provincial court Judge Sheila Whelan said Thursday.Ms. Finley was charged before the federal government changed its policy last summer, making completing the long-form census voluntary rather than mandatory.She was facing a maximum penalty of a $500 fine and a jail sentence of up to three months.Judge Whelan said a fine would not deter Ms. Finley, who had already incurred considerable expense fighting the charge rather than fill in the form.Ms. Finley argued at trial that the long-form census breached her constitutional right to privacy.Judge Whelan found last week that Ms. Finley had not proved her Charter rights had been violated.Despite the finding of guilt, the Judge let Ms. Finley off without a criminal record.“I didn’t know what to expect because I totally did not expect a guilty verdict in the first place,” Ms. Finley told reporters. “So this is welcomed.”In passing sentence, Judge Whelan referred to a July, 2010 statement from Industry Minister Tony Clement, who said the Government of Canada had received complaints from citizens who felt the long-form was an intrusion of their privacy.“The government does not think it is necessary for Canadians to provide Statistics Canada with the number of bedrooms in their home, or what time of the day they leave for work, or how long it takes them to get there. The government does not believe it is ­appropriate to force Canadians to divulge detailed personal information under threat of prosecution,” Mr. Clement said in the statement.While the privacy issue was the basis of the legal challenge, Ms. Finley has always been frank about the fact her unwillingness to participate was largely to protest the involvement of Lockheed Martin Canada.The federal government bought computer hardware and software from the U.S.  aerospace manufacturer and advanced technology firm. It also contracted out printing of census forms to the Canadian subsidiary of the huge company.Ms. Finley has said she feared census information could be obtained by the company and objected to Canada giving business that would enrich the military-industrial complex.“For me this is not over, and it’s not over for many, many other Canadians,” she said.
