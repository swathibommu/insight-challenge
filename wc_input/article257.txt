Holdouts to the LED Christmas light revolution are finding it harder to
get replacement bulbs for well-loved incandescent strings that have
been passed on within families.Steve Walls of Oklahoma has been
using the same old-style, torpedo-shaped Christmas lights for years.
But to replace the half-dozen or so bulbs that burned out last year,
Walls had to visit eight stores before he found any."They're
not the same. They're weird looking. They're sized different and have
these unusual ripples. If you have those interspersed with your
traditional lights, they're going to look dumb," he said.Many
people aren't willing to trade the brighter, colourful halo effect on
the incandescent light for the softer glow of a light-emitting diode,
or LED. As retailers increasingly stock the more energy-efficient
lights, lovers of the classic lights scramble to find them, fearing
they will soon be gone from shelves for good.Full storyHave
