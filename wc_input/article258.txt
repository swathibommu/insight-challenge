If Canadians seem to be in an extra-cautious mood this RRSP season,
it's not hard to see why. The effects of the recent recession that saw
many lose their jobs and nest eggs continued to be felt late into 2009.
Wary investors are wondering what's next.
&amp;nbsp;
That volatility and uncertainty have left some Canadians sitting on a
mountain of cash, according to industry figures, with banks now
competing for those extra dollars.
&amp;nbsp;
With many investment options available to Canadians this year,
including Tax-Free Savings Accounts, where will you put your money?
&amp;nbsp;
Recent reports also
suggest Canadians are worried about not being able to save enough for
retirement. A survey by the Royal Bank claims the number of Canadians
who believe they are not prepared financially for their golden years
has jumped since 2007.
&amp;nbsp;
Fifty-three per cent of those surveyed who have established financial
goals feel they are somewhat short or nowhere close to where they think
they should be to ensure a comfortable retirement. That was up from 36
per cent in a similar poll the bank did three years ago.
Especially surprising was the gap between men's and women's retirement
savings goals. Men had a retirement goal of $922,000 in 2007, which
fell to $555,000 in 2009. Women had a retirement goal of $556,000 in
2007, which fell to $419,000 in 2009.
&amp;nbsp;
"Clearly the recent economic turmoil has had an especially sobering
effect on men's savings objectives," said Lee Anne Davies, head of
retirement strategies for RBC Royal Bank.
