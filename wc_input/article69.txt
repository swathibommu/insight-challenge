OTTAWA - The opposition saved the gun registry, now they're trying to
rescue the mandatory long-form census.
The Liberals are set to introduce a private member's bill that would
make the long form mandatory under the Statistics Act.
Right now, the act only refers to the requirement to hold a census
every five years.
The Conservatives axed the mandatory long-form in June and replaced it
with a voluntary survey.
They said many Canadians found the long form intrusive, and they
objected to the threat of penalties for not filling it out.
Leaders of the NDP and Bloc Quebecois say they would support a bill to
bring the long-form census back.
The Liberal bill would also remove the threat of jail time for those
who do not fill out the long form.
