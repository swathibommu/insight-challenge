Happy Hour Roundup

* The Blue Dog snarls: Dem Rep. Heath Shuler boasts that he  called Nancy Pelosi a loser to her face.
* Charlie Rangel is  found guilty of 11 ethics violations, and Jonathan Capehart explains why  Rangel deserves censure, not expulsion.
* David Kurtz says that aside from the violations themselves, the fact that Rangel  continues to thumb his nose at the whole process is itself grounds for punishment.
* Chris Cillizza reports that Gentry Collins, a former top RNC aide who penned a  scathing letter about Michael Steele's tenure, is  now weighing a run for RNC chair.
Not sure what kind of message it sends for the GOP's chief political operative to be named "Gentry," but whatever...
* Are earmarks the new individual mandate for the Mittster? Romney is now styling himself as an anti-earmarks hero, but he  sure seemed to love earmarks as Governor of Massachusetts.
* Not exactly a compromising bunch: GOP senators John Thune and Susan Collins say  no dice to Chuck Schumer's suggested compromise of ending the tax cuts only on millionaires.
* Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner predicts a  compromise on the Bush tax cuts, though he reiterated that Obama wants a permanent extension of the middle class ones, so it's unclear what the basis for the "compromise" would be.
* Indeed, a top House Republican is reiterating that  extending both categories of cuts for different durations is a total nonstarter.
* It's a non-starter, of course, because it could require Republicans to  push later for just an extension of the cuts for the top two percent of Americans, which isn't exactly great politics.
* Jed Lewison  defines the choice facing Dems on the Bush tax cuts: "Fight or flight? What will it be?"
* Dems across the country are  pretty much evenly divided over the prospect of minority leader Nancy Pelosi, 45-47.
* Sam Stein on a  new non-partisan report that finds health reform will help reduce the deficit if it is fully implemented.
As Sam wryly points out, the report might give "a bit of pause for those eager to overturn or de-fund the legislation." Or maybe not?
* As it happens, Americans  think health care is a more important problem than the deficit. They think jobs and the economy are much more important problems than the deficit.
* Tolerance on parade: Byron Tau reports that  some conservatives are boycotting the Conservative Political Action Conference because one gay Republican group is participating.
* Dick Cheney says  "history is starting to come around" on George W. Bush. Maybe Cheney's referring to that  Rasmussen poll finding a majority thinks Bush was neither the best nor the worst president ever?
* And Kevin Huffman  calls on Doug Schoen and Pat Caddell to voluntarily agree to stop writing opinion pieces -- for the good of the nation.
