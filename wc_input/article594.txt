OTTAWA — The Conservative government did not meet the five-day deadline to produce documents on the census controversy and is ignoring the will of Parliament by failing to co-operate, Liberal MP Mark Holland said Thursday.At last week’s mid-summer meeting of the House of Commons committee on industry, science and technology on the controversial changes to the 2011 census, a motion was passed requesting all documents and emails between Statistics Canada, the Privy Council Office and Industry Tony Clement’s office related to the matter. The material was to be delivered to the committee within five days and that deadline passed with zero documents received by the committee clerk.“It has become abundantly clear that the Conservatives have ignored the will of the committee and are refusing to provide any of the documents that have been requested,” Mr. Holland said at a press conference.The opposition Liberals are seeking to convene yet another meeting of the industry committee to hear from more witnesses that are opposed to the government’s decision to cancel the mandatory long-form census in favour of a voluntary household survey.If they get their way, members of the committee could be called back from their ridings again. Conservative MPs were in Ottawa on Thursday for a national caucus meeting and on their way into the meeting, several of them downplayed the census controversy.“It’s not an issue that people are going to live and die on. Imean it’s not a big issue,” said Gordon O’Connor, the Conservatives’ parliamentary whip who is responsible for caucus solidarity. “It may be a big issue among all the groups that care about it [if] they want free data. And it may be a big thing for the media if they can write stories for the summer. But I’m saying, so far, I’m probably going to invite more things now, but so far, I’ve had seven [complaints].”The Liberals on the other hand, say the decision is “too big to let go,” according to Holland.“I think we have to continue to push to get this fixed because the stake are so high,” he said.Holland urged the government to relent on its position and explore options in the spirit of compromise.“If it is jail time the Conservatives are most concerned about, let’s look at eliminating jail time. No one has ever been sent to jail for not filling out a census anyway,” he said.The National Statistics Council, the advisory body for Statistics Canada, has suggested the government compromise by administering both the household survey and the long-form census next year, but the government hasn’t accepted the idea.
