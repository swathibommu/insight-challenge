MONTREAL - Quebec's statistics-gathering agency says the mandatory
long-form national census should be reinstated â€” even if it causes
delays in the upcoming 2011 census.
L'Institut de la statistique du Quebec has also proposed a longer-term
solution to deal with the 2016 census. It says Canada could study the
best census practices around the world and implement them here.
The provincial department was quite vocal this summer when controversy
arose over Ottawa's decision to replace the mandatory long-form census
with a voluntary one.
It denounced the Harper government's decision, arguing it would
diminish the quality, reliability and consistency of census data.
It now maintains that getting rid of the mandatory long form will
result in additional costs for the municipal, provincial and federal
governments, which all made use of the statistics.
The institute suggests that Statistics Canada put in place a mechanism
that would consult stakeholders and study the best practices around
the world.
It says any recommendations could be implemented in time for the 2016
census.
