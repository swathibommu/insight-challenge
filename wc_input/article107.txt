OTTAWA - A parade of witnesses is urging MPs to save the mandatory
long census form.
A day-long Commons committee is hearing from think tanks, native
groups, community groups and other interested parties who say the
mandatory long form is vital to the integrity of the statistics
system.
They say the data collected in the form is important for a host of
reasons, from planning community infrastructure to helping businesses
respond to consumer demand.
They say, however, that the threat of jail for refusing to fill out
the long form should be eliminated.
And they say the questions on the form should be scrutinized carefully
to minimize the intrusiveness of the census.
The Harper government is killing the mandatory long form because it
says it's too coercive and intrusive.
