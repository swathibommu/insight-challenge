OTTAWA - Liberals say the Harper government has adopted a deliberate
strategy of hiding information from Canadians in order to advance a
right-wing social and crime agenda.
Liberal MP John McCallum points to two recent examples to prove the
point: The government's decision to scrap the mandatory long-form
census and its refusal to release a positive report on the long-gun
registry.
He calls the approach "a triumph of ignorance over knowledge . . .
ideology over science."
And he says the recent moves demonstrate that Prime Minister Stephen
Harper is afraid of an informed electorate.
McCallum says the decision to turn the compulsory long-form census
into a voluntary survey is aimed at robbing federal, provincial and
municipal governments of the reliable data they need to deliver
progressive social programs.
He says Liberals will introduce a private member's bill as soon as the
House of Commons resumes work next month that would restore the long-
form census and prevent governments from tinkering with it in future
without the consent of Parliament.
