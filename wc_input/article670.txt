n"&gt;Aug 13 (Reuters) - The following are top stories from
selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these
stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.
THE GLOBE AND MAIL: - The RCMP is alleging in court documents that three Canada
Revenue Agency employees participated in the launch of a
Montreal company that helped construction firms avoid paying
federal taxes. - The Conservative government added millions of dollars in
performance pay for public service executives during the
recession even as it pledged to slash bonuses in the face of
hard times. BUSINESS SECTION: - The shutdown of a key U.S. Enbridge (ENB.TO) pipeline is
exacting a mounting toll across the North American oil
industry, pinching profits, putting thousands of jobs at risk
and threatening gasoline shortages. NATIONAL POST: - The federal government still has a court challenge on its
hands over cancelling the long-form census despite its latest
efforts to quell the controversy, and the Conservatives quickly
rejected a call to make its replacement survey mandatory. FINANCIAL POST: - Research In Motion Ltd (RIM.TO) is once again refusing to
back down in the face of a possible suspension of its
BlackBerry services in India. The company said the only time it
allows carriers to access the data sent via BlackBerry devices
is in the case of national security situations, and even then,
only as "governed by the country's judicial oversight and rules
of law."
