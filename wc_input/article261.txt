Compulsive
eating of rich food triggers some of the same addiction-like responses
in the brain as heroin, a study on rats suggests.When U.S.
researchers offered rats high-calorie foods such as bacon, sausage, cake
and chocolate on top of their healthier but less appetizing chow, the
animals overconsumed calories, quickly gained weight and continued to
overeat -- even when they knew they'd receive an unpleasant electric
shock.On the other hand, rats fed a healthy diet with little
access to junk food would stop eating the snacks when they knew a shock
was coming.When the junk food was removed and the researchers tried
to offer just the healthier "salad bar option," the rats refused to eat,
and the animals nearly starved themselves for two weeks."These
data are, as far as we know, the strongest support for the idea that
overeating of palatable food can become habitual in the same manner and
through the same mechanisms as consumption of drugs of abuse," said
study co-author Paul Kenny, a neurobiologist at the Scripps Research
Institute in Jupiter, Fla.Read
