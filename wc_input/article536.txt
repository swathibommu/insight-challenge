OTTAWA — The federal government plans to drop the threat of jail time for not filling out the short-form census questionnaire, Industry Minister Tony Clement announced Wednesday. The government will also add two more language questions to the questionnaire, a move that appears to have been made to ward off a court challenge from a coalition of francophone groups.“The government is announcing today its intention to introduce legislation this fall to remove threats of jail time for persons refusing to fill out the census and all mandatory surveys administered by the federal government,” Mr. Clement said in a statement.The announcement makes no mention of the long-form census questionnaire, which is being replaced by a new voluntary survey. Canadians had still been subject to a fine or jail time for not filling out the short census, but the government now says it will introduce legislation in the fall to remove the jail threat.The mandatory short-form census will now be changed so that it asks Canadians whether they can speak English or French well enough to conduct a conversation, what language they speak most often at home and whether they speak any other languages on a regular basis at home. Those three questions were previously included on the long-form census.Meanwhile, Federal Court Justice Roza Aronovitch has agreed to fast-track legal proceedings against the Harper government to reverse its decision to scrap the mandatory long-form census.A federation representing Francophone and Acadian Canadians launched the challenge this summer arguing that the government’s decision contravenes the Official Languages Act and its obligations to provide services for minority French-speaking communities across the country.The data from long-form census questions on language used in the workplace and at home help determine which regions and offices require services in both official languages.The federation asked the court to fast-track the case with time running out before the government proceeds with the modified 2011 census. Government lawyers had argued for more time, suggesting that the case be heard after Oct. 19.But in a ruling issued Wednesday morning, Ms. Aronovitch sided with the federation, agreeing that mid-October might be too late and describing the issue as one of important public interest relating to the language rights of Canadians.Arguments in the case will now be heard on Sept. 27 and 28.
