OTTAWA — The Conservative government has agreed to reconvene a parliamentary committee to explain its decision to scrap Canada’s long-form census and replace it with a voluntary survey — a move that’s received widespread public condemnation since it was made public three weeks ago.On Sunday, the Tories called for a meeting of the Industry, Science and Technology Committee as soon as possible to discuss the change to the census, a call that comes just days after the Liberals said they would seek to reconvene the committee and force the Conservatives to explain their actions. “It is not legitimate for the state to threaten citizens with jail time and fines because they refuse to divulge unnecessary personal and private information,” MP Maxime Bernier said in a statement. “The federal government’s recent decision to make the long-form portion of the census voluntary gives Canadians the freedom to choose whether they want to divulge their personal, private information.”Industry critic Marc Garneau said on Wednesday he would ask for the committee to meet and insist that Industry Minister Tony Clement, who oversees Statistics Canada, provide evidence of the privacy concerns that prompted what Mr. Garneau called a “secretive, manipulative move.”“This is a government that on a daily basis from 2006 talked about transparency and accountability, and is completely hypocritical about the need to be transparent and to be open with Canadians,” Mr. Garneau said. On June 26, with no public consultation or advance notice, the Conservatives announced they would scrap the long-form mandatory census questionnaire that has collected information on issues such as ethnicity, income, education, occupation and disabilities. Those questions will instead be asked on the voluntary National Household Survey in 2011, while the short-form questionnaire, with eight basic questions on the number of people in a household, their age, sex and mother tongue, will remain mandatory. The Tories say the short-form census questionnaire will provide sufficient information about the population for effective governing and decision-making, and they maintain the government has no right to force Canadians to answer questions about their homes, families or daily routines.Mr. Clement says the decision was made in response to widespread complaints from citizens that the mandatory long form, which was previously distributed to 20% of households, was “invasive” and “coercive.” However, a report from Statistics Canada detailing public response to the 2006 census contains no privacy complaints, and Canada’s privacy commissioner has received just three complaints in the past decade, none of them upheld.Municipalities, researchers, statisticians and a broad range of community and academic associations have publicly panned the government’s decision, saying a voluntary questionnaire is less likely to be completed by groups such as immigrants, allophones and those with low income or education, producing a skewed demographic portrait and undermining the country’s statistical information.Postmedia News
