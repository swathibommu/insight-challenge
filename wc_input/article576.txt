OTTAWA — The Harper government’s decision to scrap the mandatory long-form census is no matter of life and death, the Conservative party’s parliamentary whip said Thursday.“It’s not an issue that people are going to live and die on. I mean it’s not a big issue,” said Gordon O’Connor, who is responsible for enforcing caucus solidarity and ensuring that MPs stay on message. “It may be a big issue among all the groups that care about it [if] they want free data. and it may be a big thing for the media if they can write stories for the summer. But I’m saying, so far, I’m probably going to invite more things now, but so far, I’ve had seven [complaints].”The government announced its decision to scrap the mandatory long-form census and replace it with a voluntary form at the beginning of the summer prompting a backlash and criticism from economists, business leaders and minority groups among others who argued that it would affect the quality of data and information compiled by Statistics Canada about the population.The decision even prompted the head of the federal statistics agency, Munir Sheikh, to resign, and one Conservative MP, James Rajotte, to write a letter to Industry Minister Tony Clement expressing the concerns of his constituents in the riding of Edmonton-Leduc.But other Conservative MPs who headed into a summer caucus retreat downplayed suggestions that the issue is affecting the government’s approval rating in the population. Transport, Infrastructure and Communities Minister John Baird said he has only received “a few calls” about the matter.“But I probably have more census people [from Statistics Canada] working in my riding,” said Mr. Baird, who represents the riding of Ottawa West-Nepean.The government has said it hopes the caucus meeting will focus on its policies to create jobs and promote economic growth.“Our economy is gradually recovering from a recession which is good news,” said Finance Minister Jim Flaherty.Treasury Board President Stockwell Day was also expected to announce new measures to increase transparency in Parliament, and expand restrictions on lobbying activities surrounding former and current backbench politicians in government as well as opposition.Meantime, Prime Minister Stephen Harper was scheduled to address MPs on Thursday afternoon.
