OTTAWA - The Harper government is getting an earful an influential
scientific journal over its decision to scrap the mandatory long-form
census.
An editorial in the Aug. 26 issue of the journal "Nature" calls the
decision short-sighted and says it will lower the quality and raise
the cost of information.
The editorial says scientists and policy-makers don't appreciate the
value of the census until it's too late to repair the damage.
Stephen Fienberg and Kenneth Prewitt, a former director of the U.S.
Census Bureau, wrote the editorial.
The census has become an unlikely political flashpoint this summer
since the Tories decided to end the mandatory long form in favour of a
voluntary survey.
The former head of Statistics Canada, Munir Sheikh, quit last month
after advising the government a voluntary survey would not be as
useful as the mandatory form.
