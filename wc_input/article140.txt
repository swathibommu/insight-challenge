P.O.V: Should the long-form census be mandatory or voluntary? Take our poll
Instead, the prime minister said the government will work with the public to get co-operation on providing the information.
Statisticians, religious groups, as well as some provinces and municipalities have joined a growing chorus of groups decrying the government's move to cancel the mandatory long survey, saying it will lower the quality of data gathered by the census and hinder policy-makers' decisions.
Opposition parties have accused the Conservatives of manufacturing a crisis, citing the fact that no one has ever been sent to jail for refusing to fill out the mandatory form.
Last month, Munir Sheikh, the former head of Statistics Canada, told the industry committee he resigned because he took issue with media reports quoting Industry Minister Tony Clement suggesting the agency was supporting the government's move to end the mandatory survey.
Sheikh told MPs that "no statistician in the world" would agree that a voluntary survey could serve as a substitute for a mandatory census.
