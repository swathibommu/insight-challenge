OTTAWA - The Federal Court says it will fast-track the case of a group
trying to kill Conservative government changes to the census.
A judge has ruled the Federation des communautes francophones et
acadiennes du Canada will be heard on Sept. 27-28.
The federation wants an injunction blocking the changes and argues
that the new policy is unconstitutional.
Judge Roza Aronovitch ruled the group had demonstrated that there is
an urgency to hearing the case, saying it is a question of public
interest relative to Canadians' linguistic rights.
The federation maintained the case needed to be dealt with before
October because otherwise the elimination of the mandatory long-form
census could be unstoppable.
The group insists that dropping census questions on which official
language is used in the home contravenes the Official Languages Act.
It says the information is useful in determining where linguistic
minorities are residing in the country.
