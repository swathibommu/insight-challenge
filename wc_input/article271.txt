Hospitals
are looking for ways to recycle more sterilized medical equipment
safely, given rising costs and environmental concerns.In the
March issue of the U.S. journal Academic Medicine, researchers said
reprocessing and reusing some medical devices can save hospitals
millions without risk to patients.Hospitals currently toss out
items from surgical gowns and towels to expensive ultrasonic cutting
tools after a single use. In operating rooms, single-use devices that
are taken out of the package must be thrown out because of the risk of
contamination.But resterilizing and retesting items such as the
metal tubes that are used to insert instruments, or the compression
stockings that fit around legs to prevent blood clots, could safely
reduce the amount of waste in hospitals, said Dr. Martin Makary, a
surgeon and professor of public health at Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine in Baltimore."We found there's absolutely no risk, and
there's never been a patient safety event related to reprocessing in
all our research," Makary, the study's lead author, said in an
interview with CBC Radio.Read moreShould
