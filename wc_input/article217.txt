The New Democrats are calling on the B.C. Liberal government to denounce the federal government's decision to scrap the mandatory long-form census.
The federal government announced at the end of June that the long-form part of the 2011 census would no longer be mandatory because of privacy concerns.
But B.C. NDP finance critic Bruce Ralston argues the loss of that data could undermine the province's budget process.
"It's used in planning purposes by all levels of government," he said.
"It's used by private industry in terms of their marketing efforts — the decision to locate a store, for example — but even basic stuff, like urban planners use the results to determine where to put in roads, sewers, schools, all that kind of stuff."
Ralston said he believes scrapping the census will result in "considerable economic costs."
The B.C. government, however, has said little about its position on the decision.
"I know the census is a federal responsibility and they will manage it," said Premier Gordon Campbell. "The province will work with the information that we get to make the best decisions that we can."
Rich Coleman, B.C.'s housing minister, said he doesn't use much census data anyway. "I don't think it has any effect on us at all."
Coleman said the province gathers its own data to determine who qualifies for social assistance.
