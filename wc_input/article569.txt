OTTAWA — A Federal Court justice has dismissed a challenge launched by a francophone group to overturn the Harper government’s decision to scrap the mandatory long-form census.The Federation des communautes francophones et acadienne du Canada argued the federal government had a duty under the Official Languages Act to maintain the long-form census since its data are used by dozens of institutions to establish measures to support minority language communities and monitor their progress.Marie-France Kenny, the president of the organization, said the federation is analyzing the decision and considering whether to launch an appeal.“We are very disappointed,” Kenny said. “This [long-form census] is the only reliable tool to measure the needs of the community.”But Justice Richard Boivin ruled Wednesday that existing legislation doesn’t specify that the government must maintain the census.“Under the circumstances, the court is of the opinion that there is no legislative basis on which positive measures (to support minority official language groups) should be interpreted to include the duty to collect data through a mandatory long-form census,” Justice Boivin wrote in his ruling. “Under the circumstances, there are no grounds for intervention by this court.”The federation launched its legal challenge in late July, about a month after the government announced its decision to replace the long-form census with a voluntary survey. Industry Minister Tony Clement said the government addressed concerns about supporting official languages by moving questions on the long-form questionnaire to the short-form census which will remain mandatory.“We received advice from Statistics Canada that it was important to have a solution [to address] the Official Languages Act,” Mr. Clement said after the daily question period in the House ofCommons. “It’s a solution that works for the languages and for us.”The federation argued that the data collected by the census on the long-form questionnaire was necessary for tracking development, jobs, education, health and other social factors in minority language communities. It also argued the information would allow nearly 40 government institutions to properly plan their support programs for those communities.As part of its case, the group submitted internal federal documents, which acknowledge that data from the newly proposed survey would not be as reliable as the long-form census.The federation had repeatedly asked to meet with Clement and Canadian Heritage and Official Languages Minister James Moore to discuss the issue but was not granted a meeting.In spite of continued calls from critics to reinstate the long-form census, the Harper government has maintained it is trying to spare Canadians “intrusive and personal questions” found on the survey.
