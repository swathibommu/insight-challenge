OTTAWA — Four former top bureaucrats are appealing to Prime Minister Stephen Harper to enshrine in law the independence of Canada’s chief statistician to decide on how the agency collects data, including the census.In a letter sent to Harper, the four say the government’s decision to make the long-form census voluntary has damaged Statistics Canada’s credibility and international standing. The letter was signed by two former clerks of the Privy Council Office, Mel Cappe and Alex Himelfarb, former Bank of Canada governor David Dodge and former chief statistician Ivan Fellegi, who headed the agency for more than 20 years.They say the chief statistician, not the minister, should have the power to decide on methodology and techniques the agency needs to do its job. The former bureaucrats say such responsibility has always been an implicit part of the job, reinforced by Canada’s commitment to the UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics. The letter says the furor over the long-form census called this implicit independence into question, driving home the need to clarify the role by amending the Statistics Act “to make clear that the Chief Statistician is responsible for issues of methodology and technique.”Without such changes, the “public confidence in the agency and the reliability of its statistics are likely to be reduced in the months and years ahead,” the four wrote.Dimitri Soudas, Harper’s communications director, says the government stands by its decision.“The fundamental principle we’re defending here is the right of citizens not to divulge personal information and the government not to threaten (them) with jail and fines,” he said. “That’s the fundamental principle we’re upholding.”A spokesman for Industry Minister Tony Clement added that the government is reviewing the letter and the implications of the request.“Statistics Canada has a sterling reputation and is very well respected by business, the government and all Canadians. The Statistics Act clearly lays out the role of the chief statistician, the agency and the powers of the minister responsible for StatsCan,” said Erik Waddell, Clement’s director of communications. In an interview, Cappe, who was the top public servant under former Liberal prime minister Jean Chretien, said any “ambiguity” around the role should be clarified before Harper appoints the next chief statistician. As clerk, Himelfarb served Chretien, Paul Martin and Harper. The previous chief statistician, Munir Sheikh, quit his post at Statistics Canada in July after advising the government the data collected from a voluntary survey would not be as reliable and useful a tool as the long-standing mandatory long-form census.The agency reports to a minister and cabinet does have the right to determine questions asked by the census. The chief statistician, however, should have the authority to decide on the methods and procedures to collect, process and present the data and information to the public, they say.The four proposed three amendments to the legislation governing Statistics Canada that they argue are key to ensuring the agency’s ‘stellar’ reputation and “continued public trust and confidence in Statistics Canada” and in the quality of statistical information gathered, produced and published.Other heads of agencies run their operations with an arm’s-length independence from government, such as the governor of the Bank of Canada and the Commissioner of Competition. The Conservatives’ signature Federal Accountability Act also made deputy ministers ‘accounting officers’ who are responsible and accountable for the management of their departments. In the event of a disagreement between the deputy minister and a cabinet minister over a management issue, the deputy can refer the matter to treasury board and the auditor general.The government maintains that the long-form census included intrusive questions that Canadians should not be forced to answer.The decision has been blasted by critics since it was made public. A range of interest groups, businesses, academics and statisticians say the data gleaned from a voluntary survey will be biased and is not equivalent to the solid information collected and widely used through the long-form census.Harper has steadfastly refused to back down from the decision or to accept several compromises proposed by the opposition parties, which have vowed to hold the government to account over the decision.Ottawa Citizen, with a file from Tobi Cohen, Postmedia News
