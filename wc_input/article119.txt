OTTAWA - Statistics Canada is cutting five of its surveys after being
told by the federal government to chop its budget by $7 million.
The surveys include environmental and business statistics, and are in
addition to other belt-tightening at the troubled agency.
Details of the coming reductions were obtained by The Canadian Press
under the Access to Information Act.
The agency lost its chief statistician in July, who resigned after the
government ordered next year's long-form mandatory census be ditched
in favour of a voluntary survey.
At the time, federal officials said the agency would be given an extra
$30 million to run the voluntary survey.
But a StatsCan spokesman says that additional money has not yet been
approved.
