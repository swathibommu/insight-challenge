Obama seeks to 'reconnect...young people, African-Americans, Latinos, and women' for 2010
The Democratic National Committee this morning released this clip of the president rallying the troops, if rather coolly, for 2010. Obama's express goal: &amp;quot;reconnecting&amp;quot; with the voters who voted for the first time in 2008, but who may not plan to vote in the lower-profile Congressional elections this year.
Obama speaks with unusual demographic frankness about his coalition in his appeal to &amp;quot;young people, African-Americans, Latinos, and women who powered our victory in 2008 [to] stand together once again.&amp;quot;
Turning out those so-called &amp;quot;surge&amp;quot; voters -- who turned out for the first time to back Obama, but who sat out gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia last year -- has become the Democrats' central pre-occupation for the midterm elections, and the new Democratic effort to nationalize the election around Obama and his agenda mark an attempt to energize those voters.&amp;nbsp;
