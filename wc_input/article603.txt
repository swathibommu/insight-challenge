OTTAWA — As long as the Conservative government lives up to its promises on spending cuts, Ottawa should be able to return to a budget surplus a year ahead of schedule based on how the economy is unfolding, the Conference Board of Canada said yesterday.“A more positive fiscal outcome now appears to be unfolding” for the federal government, according to a commentary co-authored by the board’s chief economist, Glen Hodgson.However, the same can’t be said for Canada’s provinces, the Conference Board warned. Provincial premiers have difficult choices ahead to wrestle down their deficits, especially in the face of an aging population that will demand more health-care services.The analysis from the Ottawa-based think-tank should come as a dose of much-needed good news for the federal Conservative government, which has found itself mired in controversy this summer over a decision to eliminate the mandatory long-form census; complaints from senior RCMP officials about Commissioner William Elliott, a Conservative appointee; and a move to forge ahead with a sole-sourced military aircraft contract worth up to $16-billion.In a commentary published on its think-tank’s website, Mr. Hodgson and senior economist Matthew Stewart said they anticipate that nominal GDP — which is growth unadjusted for inflation and represents the base from which government collects taxes — will surge 7.2% this year, compared with the 4.9% expectation in the 2010 budget. “This is a very strong first step on the path to restoring fiscal balance at the federal level.”Results on the budget front have, so far, been promising. Preliminary estimates from the Department of Finance indicate the budget deficit for the fiscal year just ended, 2009-10, came in nearly 13% smaller than anticipated — at $46.9-billion versus the $53.8-billion expectation.And last week, Finance reported the deficit for the first two months of the 2010-11 fiscal year fell, to $4.4-billion from the $7.5-billion shortfall in the comparable year-ago period. This was achieved through a big gain in GST revenue and a drop in employment insurance benefits.According to this year’s federal budget estimates, the deficit would be whittled to $1.8-billion by 2015 due in part to cuts in the public service, a freeze on foreign aid, limited growth in military spending and higher EI premiums. Those measures would net $17.6-billion in savings over five years.But Messrs. Hodgson and Stewart argue the government is on track to be near surplus in 2014, or a year ahead of schedule.“If spending restraint can be kept on track, the federal government should be able to balance its books a full year earlier than projected,” they wrote. “The federal debt-to-GDP ratio will peak at about 35% in 2010-11 — still well within manageable levels and significantly better than every other major industrial economy.”In comparison, the International Monetary Fund has projected that the debt-to-GDP ratios for industrialized economies will reach 120% by 2014, as the United States and Europe deal with the consequences from stimulus efforts and finance programs to deal with an ageing population. The United States, in particular, faces serious budget decisions, as it is set to record annual deficits of US$1-trillion.Canada is expected to be among the best-performing industrialized economies in the near-term, with the Bank of Canada projecting a 3.5% gain this year and 2.9% expansion in 2011. Plus, Canada was the first Group of Seven economy to recoup nearly all the jobs it lost during the most recent recession.But as bullish as the board is on federal finances, it is less enamoured with the state of the province’s books. Provinces have seen tax revenue shrink during the recession, at the same time they felt compelled to match federal infrastructure spending to help kick-start their economies. In the case of Ontario, which faces a $19.7-billion budget shortfall this year, program spending grew at an average annual clip of 7% over the past five years.As a whole, the board said, provincial governments have estimated their collective deficits to be almost $34-billion in fiscal year 2009-10, and are expected to improve slightly in 2010-11.“Provinces are now facing some hard choices to regain fiscal health,” the board said. “Structural changes will be needed in how services are delivered, given the health- care demands of an ageing population and the impact of those same demographics on revenues.”Financial Post
