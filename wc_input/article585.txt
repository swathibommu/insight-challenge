One of the biggest opponents of the long-form census within  the Harper government defended the mandatory survey as an  "essential" tool for Canadian society when he was industry minister,  according to a newly released letter. "Most of the questions that  appeared on the 2006 Census long-form have appeared on many  censuses," Maxime Bernier, right, wrote in a letter dated Aug. 21,  2006, as minister responsible for Statistics Canada. "These  questions continue to be essential for providing the information  needed by governments, businesses, researchers and individual  Canadians to shed light on issues of concern to all of us." The letter was sent to Liberal MP  Bryon Wilfert in response to concerns raised about the "length and detail" of the  questionnaire.
