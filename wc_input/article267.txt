TextEd.ca is an interactive website designed to make children aware of the risks of sending or receiving text messages without thinking them through.There have been recent reports across North America of everything from text bullying to pre-teens being charged with child pornography for sending explicit pictures of themselves to others.Fredericton school teacher Jared Mallard decided to sign his class up for the pilot, which incorporates games, quizzes and discussion pages. "It actually talks about healthy relationships, sharing too much information online, what a true friend can be, so it's a little more than just texting, just text-ed," said Mallard.More than 250 Grade 7 classes across Canada are participating in the pilot, a joint project of the Canadian Centre for Child Protection and the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association.If the program is approved, it could be in all Grade 7 classes across the country by next year. But many of the students at Bliss Carmen school in Fredericton say it should start as early as Grade 5 because that's when many students start getting cellphones.Read moreIf this course was offered all in schools, what grades should it be offered to?
