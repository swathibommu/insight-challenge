Going through the census files, one thing that becomes almost immediately apparent is the level of political involvement -- some might suggest overinvolvement -- in even the most minute operational matters at Statistics Canada. At one point, a ministerial staffer even asks whether it would be possible to post the questions for the new National Household Survey on the agency website before the end of July. At the same time, however, it sometimes seems as though the very same exempt staffers who were peppering Statistics Canada officials with census-related questions weren't paying much attention to the answers -- or, indeed, to the briefing material that had been prepared in advance.
