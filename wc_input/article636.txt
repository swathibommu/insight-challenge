OTTAWA — Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s government is expected to announce plans to crack down on lobbying activities in Parliament with a special focus on former and current backbench politicians from all parties on Thursday as Conservative MPs return to the nation’s capital for a summer caucus.Opposition parties demanded the changes in the aftermath of allegations that former Conservative caucus chairman Rahim Jaffer had supposedly approached some elected government officials and their staff regarding his business and federal funding programs.The RCMP subsequently cleared him of impropriety.Federal lobbying legislation currently restricts designated public office holders, such as ministers and their staff, from engaging in lobbying activities for five years after leaving government, but it does not apply to other backbench MPs and parliamentary secretaries in government. The legislation also requires lobbyists to report meetings with public office holders, but not with parliamentary secretaries or other politicians.Treasury Board President Stockwell Day, who will make an announcement along with Conservative Senator Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu on “increasing transparency in Parliament,” has said that he believes the restrictions should “be broadened to also include opposition members” as well as the office of the Opposition leader to ensure that the law is applied evenly among politicians.“Every day, there are former members of Parliament, former ministers who are in these hallways, who are in the opposition lobbies, who are in the Opposition leader’s offices and those should be reported,” Mr. Day said in May. “Leaders of the Opposition — they’re lobbied every day on a host of things. All through my time as a minister, I have had times when opposition members have come to me about a business in their riding, about labour issues in their ridings. So on both sides, I’ve always taken that at face value and sincerely. But they’ve obviously been approached by business people in their riding and they should have to report that.”Officials from Mr. Day’s and Mr. Harper’s office did not immediately return requests for comment from Postmedia News. However, an aide to Mr. Boisvenu said that he was not allowed to give an interview about lobbying before a news conference scheduled for Thursday morning.Last spring, the House of Commons unanimously called on the government to close the “apparent loophole” in the Lobbying Act that excludes parliamentary secretaries to ministers. At the time, the MPs noted that this had also been promised by the Conservatives in their 2006 campaign platform.The Harper government has said the caucus will also focus on the government’s economic stimulus plan with jobs and growth at the top of its priorities.But MPs will also be meeting following an unexpected backlash over a decision to scrap the mandatory long-form census and replace it with a voluntary questionnaire.Conservative MP James Rajotte said he has sent a letter to Industry Minister Tony Clement, forwarding a number of concerns expressed by his own constituents in the riding of Edmonton-Leduc, but he has not yet received a response.“The letter was sent because we were getting emails from constituents and what we do in many of these cases is we forward these onto the minister and say here are what those concerns are and often you get a very substantive response from the minister,” he said.Mr. Rajotte added that he was unable to say whether he would raise the issue in caucus, but explained that there were different points of view from different people in his riding.While the census issue has generated some headaches and negative media coverage for the government over the past month, a veteran pollster believes it doesn’t mean the government needs to dramatically change its approach to improve its popularity.John Wright, a senior vice-president with Ipsos Reid, said the numbers in recent opinion polls have barely changed, leaving the Conservatives in minority government territory because it is unable to gain new support in key areas of Quebec and Ontario.“I’ve been looking at this stuff for 21 years and it’s a landscape we’ve rarely visited,” Mr. Wright said. “When I look at these numbers, no matter how much people whip themselves into a frenzy and say that they’ve got to do a bunch of programs to entice more voters, the question that I would raise is, to what end?”He explained that the best strategy for the Conservatives would be to continue supporting their existing agenda in government until new ridings are added to the political map in the western part of the country that would allow the party to gain enough seats for a majority.
