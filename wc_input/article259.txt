It's been quite a year for the Canadian dollar. Another run at parity
with the U.S. dollar looked unlikely just 12 months ago.Yet, on
April 6, 2010, the dollar touched parity early in the trading day and
spent much of the day just under the even mark. That's good news if
you're planning a trip south of the border, thinking of buying a
vacation property in the sunbelt, buying shares in American companies or
running a professional sports franchise and paying your players in
American dollars.It's not so good if you depend on American

items cost more in Canada than the U.S.?Read
