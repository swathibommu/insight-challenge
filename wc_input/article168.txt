Join the CBC's national affairs editor Chris Hall and CBC
Politics blogger Kady O'Malley at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, as
they host a live virtual town hall forum on the Conservative
government's decision to scrap the mandatory long census form.
Chris and Kady will be joined by Nik Nanos, pollster and
president of Nanos Research, Roger Gibbins, president and CEO of
Canada West Foundation, Laval University economics professor Stephen
Gordon and Terrence Watson, associate editor of the Western
Standard.
The government announced late last month it would stop sending the
mandatory long form in 2011 and replace it with a voluntary national
household survey.
Industry Minister Tony Clement and other Conservative ministers
have argued that many Canadians complained to them about the
intrusiveness of the questions on the long-form census and the threat of
fines or jail time if they don't complete it.
But statisticians, researchers, academics, municipalities, religious
groups and opposition parties have decried the government's move,
arguing it will result in skewed and unreliable data and leave Canada's
policy-makers flying blind.
The panel will take your questions on the census and weigh in on the
political storm surrounding the government's decision. We will open
the discussion window at 1 p.m. ET for you to submit your questions
ahead of time.
&amp;nbsp;Since it is a
moderated event, only questions related to the issue will be
posted.
