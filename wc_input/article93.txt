HALIFAX - A lawyer representing the federal government says a
coalition of Atlantic native groups has failed to produce evidence
showing off-reserve Indians will be hurt by Ottawa's decision to scrap
the mandatory long-form census.
Kathleen McManus was responding to the group's argument in Federal
Court that replacing the mandatory long form with a voluntary survey
violates constitutional rights and equality provisions of the Charter
of Rights and Freedoms.
The group argues the voluntary nature of the 2011 national household
survey and some of its questions will produce skewed data about off-
reserve populations, leaving them at a disadvantage when compared with
non-natives.
But McManus rejected those claims, telling the Halifax court that the
group's request for a judicial review should be dismissed because it
is too soon to determine the impact of the new survey.
As well, McManus told Judge Russel Zinn that the courts should be wary
of interfering with the federal cabinet's legislative powers.
The lawyer says there's no evidence to suggest the Constitution or the
Charter were violated or that existing or future government programs
for aboriginals will be adversely affected by the data flowing from
the 2011 survey.
