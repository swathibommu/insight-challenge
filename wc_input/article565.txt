Former top officials from Statistics Canada have slammed the Conservative government’s changes to the 2011 census, joining a growing chorus of opposition to the move.The decision to axe the long census questionnaire and distribute the questions through a voluntary survey is “indefensible” and likely to result in “seriously biased” data, says Ivan Fellegi, who was chief statistician at the agency until his retirement in 2008.“We are introducing some very big bias potentially into the census data, and we are saying that we will just increase the sample size to compensate for it,” he says of the government’s insistence that distributing the survey to more households will yield sufficiently accurate results. “That really is technically completely indefensible. It’s not a political argument, it’s a technical argument, and I am speaking as an authority on that.” Some groups such as aboriginals, new immigrants, those with low income or education and the very wealthy are less likely to complete a voluntary survey, he says, leaving gaping holes in the country’s demographic portrait and potentially warping the statistical results.Meanwhile, Canada’s official languages commissioner Graham Fraser announced on Monday he is launching an investigation into the census changes.He said he wants to ensure the government upheld its obligations under the Official Languages Act when it decided to scrap the mandatory long-form census questionnaire and replace it with a voluntary survey.“When it comes to making decisions on offering services in both official languages and to evaluating the size of official language communities, information about people’s mother tongue, language spoken in the home and knowledge of both official languages are all used,” he said in a statement. “The short-form questionnaire asks only about mother tongue, which would see some people, especially newcomers, effectively counted out.”Mr. Fraser said he was concerned that relying on the new, voluntary National Household Survey for demographic information could affect official language communities in small, rural communities or make it impossible to compare with past census data.As far as concerns about privacy or intrusiveness, Fellegi says such complaints represented an “infinitesimally small percentage” of responses to the census. What’s more, he said he believes such concerns have subsided in recent years because local enumerators no longer follow up on collecting forms from their neighbours, providing another layer of anonymity.Confidentiality is a fundamental principle that is “drilled into” everyone at the agency, he says.“We are obsessed by privacy,” says Mr. Fellegi, who worked at the agency for 25 years and maintains an office there in an emeritus role.The Conservatives say they scrapped the long form because MPs received widespread complaints from constituents that the mandatory questionnaire was “invasive” and “coercive.” A comprehensive Statistics Canada report on public feedback following the 2006 census, however, contains no complaints related to privacy.Three weeks ago, the Conservatives quietly scrapped the mandatory long census questionnaire that covers income, ethnicity, religion, education, work, housing and disability and replaced it with an optional survey that will go out to one in three households next year. Previously, 80% of Canadian households received an eight-question short census questionnaire and 20% received the longer questionnaire. Ernie Boyko, director of census operations from 1991 to 1996 and a Statistics Canada employee until 2004, says the Harper government’s decision mirrors an attempt by the Mulroney government to axe the census in the mid-1980s.“It was made for economy reasons and without any consultation,” he says. “These kind of drastic moves, you don’t consult on them because you’ll never get people to agree. If you’re going to do it, you just do it, and that’s what they did.”The chief statistician at the time, Martin Wilk, made sure everyone who relied on census data knew what they’d be missing and there was “tremendous backlash”from municipalities and the business community, says Mr. Boyko, who founded one of three Facebook groups now opposing the 2011 census changes. The Mulroney government reinstated the census but told the agency to slash its budget, he says, and in response, some questions were trimmed and user fees for the data were stepped up.Doug Norris was director general of social and demographic statistics until 2005 — earning the nickname “Mr. Census” — and following his 30-year career atStatistics Canada, he became chief demographer and senior vice-president at Environics Analytics.“Canada was leading the world in terms of census-taking, and in terms of statistics, it was known at one point as the best statistical agency in the world,” he says.He believes privacy concerns around the census are overblown and says the minor hassle of asking one in five households to take 45 minutes to fill out the long form is a fair exchange for gleaning information crucial to Canadian society and the huge range of programs, businesses and non-profits that rely on it.“Moving into a knowledge-based economy, it’s hard to imagine why people don’t value that knowledge and that information much more, and doing away with it at a time when we’re going to need it more than ever is really puzzling to me,” he says. The former Statistics Canada officials join the growing ranks of experts and organizations objecting to the government’s changes to the census. The Canadian Economics Association, the Canada Census Committee, the Canadian Association of University Teachers, the Statistical Society of Canada, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives and multiple newspaper editorial boards are among those that have spoken out against the decision.When the change was announced, Canada was believed to be the only country in the world with a partially voluntary census. On Friday, it emerged that Britain’s new Conservative government plans to axe that country’s 200-year-old census entirely after the 2011 count, calling it an expensive and inaccurate way to count the population.To Mr. Fellegi, the biggest loss in eradicating the long-form questionnaire is that it will destroy the ability to track changes in Canadian society over time because there will be no way to know if fluctuations in the statistics are real or the result of different methodology. The education gap between aboriginals and other Canadians and the changing use of the French language inside and outside Quebec are two major social issues that will now be difficult to measure, he says.“It’s a fundamental preoccupation of all of us, or should be, to know whether certain very important underlying problems are getting worse or getting better or have stabilized,” he says. “I recognize that the government has every right to do what it is doing, but I regret it.”
