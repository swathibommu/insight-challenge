SASKATOON - A Saskatoon woman who was found guilty for refusing to
fill out the long-form census has been given an absolute discharge,
but that may not be the end of her fight.
Sandra Finley says she's happy with the discharge, but she's not going
to "jump up and down" because the guilty verdict still stands.
Finley says she and her lawyer are reviewing the grounds for an appeal
of verdict â€” despite the absolute discharge.
Finley refused to fill out the 2006 long-form census because
Statistics Canada had purchased the software from U.S. defence
manufacturer Lockheed Martin and because she said the questions
violated her privacy.
She faced a fine of up to $500 and a jail sentence of up to three
months.
The federal government has since said it is doing away with the
mandatory long-form census.
