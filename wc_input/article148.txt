P.O.V.: Should the census be voluntary or mandatory? Take our poll.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper spoke publicly for the first time on the issue Monday, saying it is not "appropriate" for the government to threaten Canadians with jail time or fines for failing to fill out the survey when asked.
Opposition parties have accused Harper's Conservatives of manufacturing a crisis, citing the fact that no one has ever been sent to jail for refusing to fill out the mandatory form.
For his part, Sheikh said the prime minister and the government have every right to make the decision, but urged a "further rethink."
"Given the importance of the mandatory census long form, we should have another look at it," Sheikh said.
