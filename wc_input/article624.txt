OTTAWA — The Conservative government is facing a second Federal Court fight over changes to the census — this one arguing the decision will violate the charter rights of vulnerable populations that may be under-represented on a voluntary survey.The Canadian Council on Social Development has partnered with social planning groups representing immigrants, racial minorities, poverty groups and aboriginals in launching the challenge, which they say is aimed at “defending the equal right of all Canadians to be counted.” “There’s a real and documented concern that the voluntary survey will significantly undercount marginalized communities,” says John Campey, executive director of Social Planning Toronto, one of a dozen organizations behind the court case. “It’s become clearer and clearer it will have a very serious and negative impact on a number of communities and groups that are identified under the charter, and this was one of the ways of addressing this issue.”In June, the government announced plans to replace Canada’s mandatory long-form census with a voluntary National Household Survey in 2011, a decision that faced widespread public condemnation.The Conservatives say the move was made to minimize intrusions into citizen privacy while still gathering important data about the population, but critics charge a voluntary survey will leave out some groups who will be less likely to respond.Documents submitted in a previous Federal Court case launched by the Federation of Francophone and Acadian Communities of Canada showed the government acknowledged internally that some data from the new voluntary survey would likely be unusable. That case was ultimately unsuccessful in forcing the government to reverse its decision, although it did prompt the government to move some language questions to the mandatory short-form census.“[We were] disappointed in the outcome, but the grounds on which we’re pursuing this are substantially different,” Mr. Campey says of the francophone organization’s fight. “We’re saying that essentially all of the groups that are protected or identified deserve the same treatment that the government provided to try to avoid the challenge.” The government’s decision to move some language questions to the short form “bolsters the argument that the government sees some groups as more equal to others,” he says.Erik Waddell, spokesman for Industry Minister Tony Clement, who oversees Statistics Canada, said:“We cannot comment on a case that is currently before the courts. We continue to work toward implementing a successful census and National Household Survey in 2011.”Mr. Campey said the timeline for their challenge to move through the court system is unclear at the moment, but one of the points they’re striving to make is that there’s still ample time for the government to change its mind.“It continues to mystify us, why they’d be so out of line and stay so out of line with the vast majority of Canadian individuals and organizations,” he says. “Despite the fact that they would like us all to believe it’s a done deal, in fact right up until when the survey goes into the mailbox, the covering letter on the voluntary survey could be changed from, ‘We’d kind of like you to fill this out if you’re not too busy and there’s nothing good on TV’ to ‘You’re a sample that is required to return this.’”
