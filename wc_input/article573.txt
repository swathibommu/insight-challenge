OTTAWA — As court arguments wrapped up in a battle over the federal government’s decision to scrap the long-form census, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said the Conservatives would stick with their plan out of respect for Canadians who don’t want to be coerced into answering the questionnaire.“We recognize that some people are a bit hesitant regarding their private life,” Harper said in the House of Commons on Tuesday in response to a question from Bloc Quebecois Leader Gilles Duceppe. “We intend to work co-operatively with the population. We don’t threaten to prosecute them for being hesitant. We work with them as adults.”A few blocks away, a Federal Court judge said he would review arguments and make a ruling as soon as possible whether to accept a bid to overturn the Harper government’s decision.Justice Richard Boivin made the comments after hearing from lawyers representing the government and an organization representing French-Canadians which is challenging the decision on the grounds it violates the Official Languages Act.Rene LeBlanc, a senior general counsel from the Justice Department, told Mr. Boivin existing language legislation says nothing about the census, but rather about the government’s obligations toward services in minority communities.“There’s no part of this law that requires the collection of data,” said Mr. LeBlanc. “The law itself contains no requirement of the sort.”Mr. LeBlanc’s arguments came one day after Rupert Baudais, the lawyer for the Federation des communautes francophones et acadienne du Canada, argued that the government has a duty to maintain the long-form census since its data is used by dozens of federal institutions to establish measures to support minority language communities and monitor their progress.But Mr. LeBlanc cast doubt on whether there were problems with the government’s new solution to introduce a voluntary National Household Survey to replace the mandatory long-form census.“No one, not even the experts, can say with certainty, say that the data of the National Household Survey will be of no usefulness.”The federation launched its legal challenge in late July, about a month after the government announced its decision and after a series of attempts to contact federal ministers that were met with silence. As part of its case, it has submitted internal federal documents which acknowledge that data from the newly proposed survey would not be as reliable as the long-form census.In a rebuttal to the government’s arguments, Mr. Baudais said that the law doesn’t require the federation to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the survey would fail to produce usable data, but rather that the preponderance of evidence indicates the risk of the new government plan.He said the federation has adequately made that case, and that it’s now up to the government to demonstrate whether it has a new solution to provide information required by federal institutions to develop programs and measures in support of minority language communities.After watching the court proceedings, Liberal MP Mauril Belanger said government lawyers had misinterpreted the intent of legislation on language policy that was adopted in 2005 to oblige the government to act to support minority English and French-speaking communities.Parliament is expected to adopt a motion this week, introduced by the Liberals, that also calls on the government to reinstate the long-form census, but Harper said he will continue to defend people who don’t want to be forced to divulge personal information in detailed questions on the questionnaire.“The Conservative position is a lot more responsible and respectful toward the population,” Mr. Harper said.In an earlier debate, Industry Minister Tony Clement said the government had already compromised by adding questions about languages onto the short-form census which remains a mandatory questionnaire for Canadians to complete.“I can assure this House that all questions relating to the official languages asked on the 2006 census will be maintained in the 2011 version, including knowledge of official languages, mother tongue and languages spoken at home,” he said.The federation argued that this data would be inadequate without additional information about education, health, employment and immigration status to measure how communities are developing.with files from Meagan Fitzpatrick, Postmedia News
