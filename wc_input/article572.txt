A Saskatchewan woman was found guilty in Saskatoon provincial  court Thursday for refusing to fill in the long-form census in 2006.  "I'm stunned," Sandra Finley said outside court immediately after  the verdict. The Saskatoon woman said she will study the written  decision and discuss with her lawyer whether to file an appeal. She  also invoked the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Ms. Finley doesn't  feel Canadians should be forced to reveal personal information to  the federal government, such as their ethnicity, sexual preference,  occupation or other information. Ms. Finley will be sentenced on  Jan. 20. The maximum penalty is three months in jail with a $500  fine. The federal government decided last year that the long-form  census would no longer be mandatory.
