OTTAWA - Newly released documents show that the former head of
Statistics Canada was set to speak out about the Harper government's
controversial census change just before he abruptly quit his post.
The papers reveal that Munir Sheikh was going to tell staff that a
voluntary long-form census survey would not be as effective as the
current mandatory one.
They also show that the Privy Council Office — which serves the prime
minister — was trying to control the statistics agency's public
comments on the matter.
The revelations come from almost 200 pages of emails and briefing
notes released today in response to a request by the House of Commons
industry committee.
In an unusual move, the government leaked the documents to the media
before they were distributed to committee members.
Most of the documents were generated after the final decision was made
and some are blacked out, giving little insight into discussions
between Statistics Canada and the government.
