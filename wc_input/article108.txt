OTTAWA - A group representing francophones outside Quebec is making
its case for the mandatory long census before a Federal Court judge.
The group had called for a judicial review of the Conservative
government's decision to scrub the long form and replace it with a
voluntary survey.
The group's lawyer is telling the court the decision violates the
Official Languages Act.
In the act, the government is directed to take actions that will help
the development of linguistic minorities and enhance their vitality.
Critics argue that without data from the mandatory long form,
government departments won't be able to carry out those obligations.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his cabinet have argued the
mandatory long form was intrusive and its threat of jail time overly
coercive.
The court heard that the first week of October would be the latest
that Statistics Canada could make changes to the census process.
The presentation by the Federation of Francophone and Acadian
Communities is part of a series of arguments for and against the
mandatory long-form census now before the Federal Court.
