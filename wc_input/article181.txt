P.O.V.: Should the long-form census be mandatory or voluntary? Take our poll.
"We are calling on this prime minister to finally listen to the will of Parliament, abide by the rule of law, and honour this bill when it is passed."
Harper and the Conservatives have shown little sign of backing down from their June decision, insisting the mandatory census demands too much private information from Canadian citizens.
Bennett's bill comes less than a day after the House of Commons adopted a Liberal motion that also called for the return of the mandatory long-form census. That motion, which passed 152-141 late Wednesday night, is a largely symbolic move the Conservatives are expected to ignore.
